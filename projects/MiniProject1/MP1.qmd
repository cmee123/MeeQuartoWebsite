Mini Project 1 explores data from the United States government regarding the population of licensed drivers in the US. Below are 2 static maps and 2 interactive maps showing the distribution of driver population size and proportion of male vs female drivers across every state.

  )
```

This map shows us how many total drivers are in each state. We can see that states with higher populations and larger urban areas (California, Texas, Florida) have more licensed drivers.

```

This is a coded map showing the distribution of male and female drivers for all contiguous states in the US. The variable displayed is categorical, with the 2 categories being "Majority Female" and "Majority Male". Based on this graph, we can see that most states have a majority female population of drivers. The south west, pacific northwest, and Midwest regions are almost all majority male drivers, and almost every other state is a majority female.
